# jQuery Touch Carousel

* This is an HTML content carousel written in JavaScript specifically to achieve the feel of a native carousel widget on iOS.
* Supports both Touch and Mouse events.
* It is optimized to use % units to automagically calculate animations, and tolerate resizing.
* It uses CSS3 transitions to offload animations when available in iOS, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
* It uses CSS3 translation, or 3D translation when possible, for maximum graphics acceleration.
* Support for continuous marco polo style looping.
